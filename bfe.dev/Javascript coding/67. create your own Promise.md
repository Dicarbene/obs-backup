[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise "null") is widely used nowadays, hard to think how we handled [Callback Hell](http://callbackhell.com/ "null") in the old times.

Can you implement a `MyPromise` Class by yourself?

At least it should match following requirements

1.  new promise: `new MyPromise((resolve, reject) => {})`
2.  chaining : `MyPromise.prototype.then()` _[then handlers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/then "null") should be called asynchronously_
3.  rejection handler: `MyPromise.prototype.catch()`
4.  static methods: `MyPromise.resolve()`, `MyPromise.reject()`.

This is a challenging problem. Recommend you read about Promise thoroughly first.

### Solution

Time complexity: $O(n)$
Space complexity: $O(n)$
