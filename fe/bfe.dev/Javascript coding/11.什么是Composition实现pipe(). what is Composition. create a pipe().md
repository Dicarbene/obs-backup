what is Composition? It is actually not that difficult to understand, see [[whatthefuck.is+composition]]
Here you are asked to create a `pipe()` function, which chains multiple functions together to create a new function.

Suppose we have some simple functions like this

```js
const times = (y) =>  (x) => x * y
const plus = (y) => (x) => x + y
const subtract = (y) =>  (x) => x - y
const divide = (y) => (x) => x / y
```

Your `pipe()` would be used to generate new functions

```js
pipe([
  times(2),
  times(3)
])  
// x * 2 * 3

pipe([
  times(2),
  plus(3),
  times(4)
]) 
// (x * 2 + 3) * 4

pipe([
  times(2),
  subtract(3),
  divide(4)
]) 
// (x * 2 - 3) / 4
```

**notes**

1.  to make things simple, functions passed to `pipe()` will all accept 1 argument

### Solution

```ts
type Func = (arg: any) => any

function pipe(funcs: Array<Func>): Func {
	// your code here
	let fn:Func = (arg)=>{
		let ans = arg;
		funcs.map(tFn=>ans = tFn(ans));
		return ans;
	}
	return fn;
}
```
